# Giphy Browser

ðŸ–¼ This project is a simple React GIF Browser.

## My Goal

My purpose in creating this project was to experiment with integrating external web APIs with my app.
I used the Giphy API for this experiment since it allowed me to browse through a large number of gifs.

## Usage

ðŸ§± To utilize this project, go through the following steps:

- Install dependencies via `npm install`
- Set the [API Key]() in `App.js Line 6`
- Run the project via `npm run`

The Trending Gifs will be featured by default on the main page, but you may also search for a topic to find related gifs.
